## Original Code

A general TransE implementation:

- https://github.com/thunlp/KB2E

A Python and Tensorflow implementation used in this model:

- https://github.com/ZichaoHuang/TransE

## Description

- TransE embed entities and relationships of metarelational data in low-dimensional vector spaces. TransE models relationships by interpreting them as translations operating on the low-dimensional embeddings of the entities. The task of this method includes embedding the training data, and using the embeddings to predict head/tail entities.

  *This image shows the idea of interpreting relation(r) as transitions from head entity(h) to tail entity(t).

- The TransE model provided in this repository contains functions to read a training file as input, to learn embeddings of the inputs, and to preform evaluations on the embeddings. 

## Benchmarks

- WN18 - WordNet dataset in format of <head_entity, tail_entity, relation>
- FB15k - FreeBase dataset of size 15k in format of <head_entity, tail_entity, relation>
- YAGO - original dataset in format of <head_id, relation_id, tail_id>, cleaned to format <head_entity, tail_entity, relation> for this model to use.

## Input and Output

- Input for embedding:

  - Files:

    - train.txt (in the format of <head_entity, tail_entity, relation>)

    - test.txt (can be split from train.txt)

    - valid.txt (can be split from train.txt)

    - entity2id.txt (<entity_name, eneity_id>)

    - relation2id.txt (<relation_name, relation_id>)

      *entity2id.txt  and relation2id.txt can be generated from train.txt by assigning each entity and relationship a unique id.

  - Parameters:

    - input_folder : containing all the input files
    - dimension: dimension to embed each entity and relationship to
    - marginal_value: goal value to stop iteration
    - batch_size: batch size for gradient descent
    - max_epoch: max number of iterations



- Output:
  - embedded_entity.txt (in format <entity_name: embedding>)
  - embedded_relation.txt(in format <relation_name: embedding>)

## About this repository

- Main.py
  - run main.py to see what this embedding model does
  - It will embed the data in <i> ./data/YAGO</i> with <i>dimension=300, marginal_value=1.0, batch_size=4800, max_epoch=3</i>
  - Outputs of embeddings are <i>output_embedded_entity.out</i> and  <i>output_embedded_relations.out</i> 
  - <i>output_entity_dict.txt</i> shows original entity along with its imbedded vector space representation.
  - Evaluation shows MearnRank and Hits@10
- Tests
  - <i>test_transE.py</i> in the <i>tests</i> folder preform unit tests on the refactorized model. It ensures the returning type and dimensions of the output.
  - It preforms tests on YAGO benchmark
- Jupyter Notebook:
  - https://github.com/sandiexie-USC/ditk/blob/develop/graph/embedding/TransE/TransE.ipynb
  - This Jupyter Notebook is a notebook format similar to main.py, providing visualization of each step.

## Evaluation

|       | epoch | MeanRank | Hits@10 |
| ----- | ----- | -------- | ------- |
| WN18  | 1000  | 243      | 79.9    |
| FB15k | 1000  | 546      | 36.8    |
| YAGO  | 1000  | 5786     | 0.001   |
