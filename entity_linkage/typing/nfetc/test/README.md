NER-with-ls model needs pre-trained embedding for Lexical Simiarlity, word-embedding, Character and Captalized embedding. So I uploaded conll.joblib and ontonotes.joblib under 'data' folder. This is also a reason why I cannot use group common input type; I need to know where the words in input are embedding(conll.joblib OR ontonotes.joblib). <br>







For NFETC model, you can put 2 types of input; **raw_data**, **clean_data**.<br>
1) **clean_data.tsv**<br>
Corpus input format is ["start position", "end position", "text", "mention", "Type(s)"]. 
There are 3 lines of sample clean data input.
```
6	7	OK , we 'll call him General Ye Ting .	him General Ye	/person/title
7	8	OK , we 'll call him General Ye Ting .	General Ye Ting	/location
0	1	Very naughty ?	<PAD> Very naughty	/other/art/music
```

2) **raw_data.txt**<br>
If you download publicabily avaliable data that the original NFETC github suggests to download, you will get raw data. (http://www.cl.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/~shimaoka/corpus.zip)
It will have uncleaned data as last column, at the end; ["start position", "end position", "text", "Type(s)", "raw_info_data"]
```

## To run test.py with sample test data<br>
Initial setting is that a model will run with sample clean data and you can change to sample raw data in test.py file;I commented out for raw data file_path.Plue, Test script will check number of input/output rows and cols. 
Run on the ```nfetc folder``` with following command line; ``` python test/test.py```

### Embedding (glove.840B.300d)<br>
If you want to use other inputs, you must download word embedding file form http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip and replace current golve file to full size of golve word embedding file.
I uploaded downsized word embedding file due to the limitation of size (under data folder in develop branch)
