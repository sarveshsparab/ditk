This folder contains the sample unit test cases.

The output is a similarity score between 0 and 1 but the code is not written to explicitly print that score. It would generate that score internally and compare it with the actual score and print only the pearson correlation coefficient value. If you explicitly want the value in sensim.py you can write the value of the predicted variable to a file and it then it would give the same results as the unit test case output.
