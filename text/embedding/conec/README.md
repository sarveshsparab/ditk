ConEc (Context Encoders), an extension of word2vec
----------------------------------------------------
This is a Python3 implementation of the following paper - 

Context encoders as a simple but powerful extension of word2vec
Franziska Horn, Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Representation Learning for NLP, 
Association for Computational Liguistics 2017, Pages 10-14

Installation
------------

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

This will install all the prerequisite packages	for conec to run successfully

Introduction
------------
The task is to obtain embeddings for Out of Vocabulary (OOV) words and for words having multiple meanings by exploiting the word's local context

Input (For Prediction and Training)
------------------------------------
Word | Sentence | Paragraph | Document

Output (For Prediction and Training)
-------------------------------------
- Text Embedding | Average Text Embedding
- Embedding Similarity

Objective
---------
This implementation mitigates the shortcomings of word2vec in that word2vec learns only a single representation (embedding) for a word, but it is possible to have a word which means different things in different context..
For Ex. Washington (US State) vs Washington (Former President).

This code can be used to train, evaluate an use Context Encoders (ConEc), a powerful context-aware extension of word2vec. This can be used to generate text embeddings for a word with multiple meanings or for Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words by using a trained model.

Implementation
--------------
The code implements the following procedure -
- Use CBOW word2vec model with negative sampling objective
- Train the model on "text8" , "OneBilCorpus" or "conll2003" datasets
- Load the trained model from its pickle dump
- Get the global context matrix for the same dataset
- Adapt the word embeddings of the word2vec model by multiplying it the 
  word's average context vectors (CVs)
- A word has global CV and local CV
- Choice of alpha in the equation mentioned in the paper determines the emphasis on the word's local context

- Renormalize the result, so that the resulting embeddings have unit length again

Download the conec folder from this repository and import the conec class into your script

Usage
-----
`python3 main.py`
This will load a pre-trained model to get the text embeddings for a word or a sentence or a paragraph.
It can also train a new model on any of the aforementioned datasets and evaluate them accordingly.
Follow the main.py file carefully to train and evaluate on various datasets
