## Original Code
[TensorFlow implementation of Relation Classification via Convolutional Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/FrankWork/conv_relation)

## Overview
* A relation extraction model that uses Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
* Tensorflow implementation
* Input sentence is first broken down into word tokens, and each word is transformed into a word embeddings vector
* Lexical and sentence level features are extracted and concatenated to form the final feature vector
    * Sentence level features are obtained through a max-pooled CNN
* The final feature vector is fed into a softmax classifier to determine the relation type

## Input and Output
### Input
* Training and testing text files named "relation_extraction_input_train.txt" and "relation_extraction_input_test.txt" respectively
* Format is generalized for the whole group; attributes are separated by tab
```
sentence    entity1  entity1_type entity1_start_position    entity1_end_position  entity2  entity2_type entity2_start_position    entity2_end_position  relation_type
```
* Input file is preprocessed to generate files needed for the model
    * Since the model originally uses one of the benchmarks SemEval2010 Task8, no data preprocessing is needed for this specific dataset

### Output
* Output text file named "relation_extraction_output.txt"
* Format is generalized for the whole group; attributes are separated by tab
```
sentence    entity1  entity2  relation_type_predicted  relation_type_ground_truth
```
