This folder contains the unit test cases.

However this repo doesn't explicitly print the output as in the relation_extraction_output.txt.

It gives a table of the entities identified with their precision, recall and F1-score and similarly relations identified along with their precision,recall and F1-score.And it also gives an overall test score. The exact output format can be viewed in the jupyter notebook.
