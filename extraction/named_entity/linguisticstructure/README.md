#### Input:
 - Data in DITK.NER format as below - 
 ![DITK format](resources/ditk-format.png)
 
#### Output:
Returns predicted entity tags for each word in the data

#### Setup:
1. Clone the code locally
2. The execution class is located in the root directory file linguisticstructure_ner. 
    Import the LingusticStructureforNER class from linguisticstructure_ner.     
3. The project needs Senna Embeddings, Glove embeddings which can be found at- 
   
   - [Senna Embeddings](https://ronan.collobert.com/senna/)
   - [Glove Word Embeddings](http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.42B.300d.zip)
   
4. Read the dataset in the DITK format by passing in the files as a dictionary of train, test and dev.
    - Optionally run sample_test_lingustic.py from tests/ directory to verify setup
5. Execute the training module to generate model. 
6. Predict data in the test file using predict, which can be evaluated using the evaluate function.

#### Overall Task:
- Uses Linguistic Structures of text for improving NER task
- Named entities â€“ highly related to linguistic constituents in a sentence
- Encodes the constituency parse data to be used as hidden features by the BRNN-CNN neural network
- Tries to learn chunks of data in a sentence that are more likely to be named entities, classifies them
