It is a sample test of this project.

The project should take inputs in conll2012 format, which means the first four columns should be word, POS tag, chunker tag and entity tag. The number of columns should be the same among all rows. Otherwise, the input file will not pass the shape check test.

This test code checks whether the main() function can invoke the project and generate proper output. It also checks whether each test word's entity tag is predicted and saved in the proper format: (word, target entity tag, predicted entity tag).
